Feeling bored with your current path in life? Looking to try something new? Want to get lost in a Wikipedia page? 

Well, look no further than **Ologies**, the world's dumbest midnight idea! Generate a random -ology for something you probably didn't realize was a field, and (hopefully) feel ecstatic about your new passion. 

(Note: this project bears no relation to the [podcast of the same name](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/). Please don't sue me, Alie Ward!!!)
